# 24Rogue

24Rogue is a minimalist roguelike game written in pure JavaScript that uses the [24a2](https://github.com/jamesroutley/24a2) game engine.
There is no end, the game goes on indefinitely, unless it crashes before of course.

You are the green dot. Pink and purple dots are enemies. Yellow and orange dots are items.
